              <h4>Car Accident</h4>
              <br><p>Car accidents are the leading cause for personal injury claims across the country. If you were injured in a crash, there was most likely one or more negligent parties. While no amount of money is going to undue what you have suffered, having the right legal representation can make all the difference in your financial recovery.</p>

              <h4>Motorcycle Accident</h4>
              <br><p>Motorcycles have the same rights as others drivers on the road. Unfortunately, many drivers do not exercise a high level of caution when it comes to sharing the road with motorcyclists. When a motorcyclist is involved in a collision, the injuries sustained can be extremely serious. A good lawyer will help you get the compensation you deserve.</p>

              <h4>Truck Accident</h4>
              <br><p>The State of California has one of the highest numbers of semi-trucks due to the ports and ships that come in. Because these commercial trucks are so large, they often injure more than one party in a collision. This ​creates additional confusion when it comes to settlement or a lawsuit. This is why it is important for you to find an experienced lawyer to make it simple.</p>

              <h4>Uber/Lyft</h4>
              <br><p>As a driver or passenger in an accident involving Uber or Lyft, there are special considerations that are essential to the insurance and claims process. The multi-faceted nature of handling these claims with the driver’s insurance, rideshare insurance, and rideshare company create this complexity. The attorneys at Law Offices of Jim T. Nguyen have developed a plan of action for these particular types of claims.</p>

              <h4>Bicycle Accident</h4>
              <br><p>Biking is a great way to exercise, avoid traffic, and enjoy all that California has to offer. Unfortunately, many of the roads in California are not designed with bicyclists’ safety in mind. Not only that, drivers’ attitudes toward bicyclists generally range from annoyance to outright antagonism. If you were injured by a distracted or aggressive driver, you deserve to be financially compensated for your injuries.</p>

              <h4>Pedestrian</h4>
              <br><p>As pedestrians, we are particularly vulnerable to accidents involving all sorts of motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, bicycles, motorcycles, etc. When a negligent driver hits an innocent pedestrian, the resulting injuries are usually severe. The Law Offices of Jim T. Nguyen’s experienced injury lawyers can help you pursue justice and compensation if you were struck while legally walking on or along a roadway.</p>
