            <h4>“Highly recommended! I am incredibly grateful to have worked with a knowledgeable, helpful, and compassionate attorney such as Jim. He took the time to go over my personal injury case, explaining everything in layman's terms and making sure I understand what I need to do and what to expect. He is also very responsive, which I highly appreciate as I am sure we all want to get our cases dealt with as soon as possible. Jim truly cares for his clients and will go above and beyond to make sure their concerns are answered and taken care of.”</h4>

            <h4>“I got involved to a T-bone accident on Sep 2017 and my car's door got damages a lots. So i did think about getting a lawyer to handle my case but didnt know any ideals about that (first time got into a car accident for 10 year driving). So i was asking around and one of my friends gave me his law firm office's number (the one he worked before) and i contacted him. He is so good and professional, i got impressed about his knowledge and how he did handle the case for me. With his helps, i got my car fixed completely early than anyone else told me about the time i could get my car back and finish the case. I highly appreciated it and would recommend to any of my friends if they got problems with Laws or accidents or work injures... He truly cares for his clients and make sure his clients can get the right answers for their concerns.”</h4>

            <h4>“Jim's knowledge and expertise in Tenant Law was very helpful when we had to deal with an unfair landlord. Our landlord was withholding our security deposit in bad faith.  We reached out to Jim to get his advice on next steps.  Jim was very generous with his time, listened patiently to our situation and reviewed through the lease agreement.  He offered guidance on how to deal with the landlord and helped draft a demand letter. We learned a lot about tenant rights and eventually got our deposit back from the landlord thanks to Jim's advice. Thank you Jim!”</h4>

Jim assisted me in many aspects the business such as regulation compliance, labor laws, and legal liability.”</h4>

            <h4>“I had a car accident in December 2018, and after going through 3.5 months of chiropractic therapy, my case was closed by the first week of April.</h4>
            <br><h4>Jimmy was extremely helpful and patient with me throughout the entire process. I was T-boned when the other driver made an unprotected left turn; my car was deemed total loss. He was very thorough with the details of my car accident. After I talked with my insurance agent the first time to let them know I was in an accident, I never had to make another phone call and was able to leave the rest to Jimmy. I got the payment for the payout of my car and the deductible within two weeks.</h4>
            <br><h4>After I finished physical therapy, I sent Jimmy my medical reports and he handled the case with the other insurance agency for me. I received the payout in about a week. I was expecting a fair amount, but he was able to get me marginally more than I expected.</h4>
            <br><h4>Throughout the whole time, I was able to text/call and email him if I had any questions, and he always got back to me in a very timely manner. He always made sure to explain what to expect and what was happening in terms that were easy for me to understand. Anytime I needed to do something on my end, he was very detailed on what I needed to prepare for him and step by step directions if needed.</h4>
            <br><h4>He made the process very simple and was able to make a stressful situation easy. Not only is he very professional and knowledgable, but I feel that he really cares about his clients inside and outside the case! I am more than thrilled to have him as my lawyer. Thank you so much, Jimmy!”</h4>

            <h4>“There is a certain irony in writing a review praising someone whose service you hope you won't need again, but please take a moment to read on about my family's experience with a really great attorney.</h4>
            <br><h4>My family and I were fortunate to have Jim as our attorney during two related cases: the first being an Unlawful Detainer, where he successfully defended us, and on a personal injury case. During a difficult and uncertain time, Jim worked tirelessly on our behalf and was forthcoming and open with us.</h4>
            <br><h4>Jim sincerely listened to and addressed, all of our questions and concerns, with an approachability that made us feel reassured, taking the time to explain and update us regardless of when, or how many times we would call him. He listened to our frustrations and fears and helped guide us with a steadfast calm and quiet strength. For that and more, we are grateful to him.</h4>
            <br><h4>Jim is a great attorney and a kind and compassionate person, who really cares about helping people. And he doesn't give up because he truly cares for his clients. He genuinely cares for people. That's a rarity in today's world, and is one of many reasons why we recommend Jim Nguyen without reservation.</h4>
            <br><h4>If you are in need of a great attorney, with strong moral fiber, confidence and compassion, give Jim a call.”</h4>
